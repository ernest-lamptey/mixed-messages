# Mixed Messages
## About
- This project was part of my Back End Career Path Project exercises on Codecademy.
- The webpage shows a random inspirational message based on a random topic choice when the "Get Inspired" button is clicked.
## Functionality
- The "data.js" file contains all the messages and topics that are used in the project.
- The "main.js" file contains the function that is linked to the button to return the new message.
- The randomness is worked in four ways:
    1. A random subject area selection
    2. A random quote from the subject area
    3. A random title from a list of headings
    4. A random preposition to join the title to the subject area
## Comments
- This project took a while to finish as I had to work on it from scratch without any real pointers. I must mention I completed it with the help of my faithful study partner.
- I had to dig through some CSS in order to get the page looking acceptable.
- The experience has been very great and the fulfillment is even better. Hopefully, I'm getting closer to being a seasoned developer.
- Your commments and suggestion are very welcome
